# Diagnostics
Third assignment of the Artificial Intelligence course (1DL340) at Uppsala University. The concepts of Bayesian network and Metropolis in Gibbs MCMC sampling algorithm are exercised in this assignment. 

The first part of the assignment consists of fitting the Bayesian network illustrated in Diagnostics_BayesianNetwork_Image to the historical data (10000 medical patients). Each conditional distribution in the network is modeled with conditional categorical distribution.
